The Dimetrodon was a synapsid that lived 250 million years ago (that's before the age of the dinosaurs). Dimetrodons are distant relatives of mammals, and thus humans. Their name comes from their two different types of specialized teeth. While most reptiles have very simple teeth that don't fit together well and can be easily replaced, mammals have teeth that are meant for specific jobs. This is why it's harder for mammals to replace teeth than reptiles. Dimetrodon's two different types of teeth signified the beginning of this important delevopment in mammal history.
